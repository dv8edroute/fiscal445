## Description

This script was developed to simplify the determination of reporting dates when using a 445 financial calendar. Many companies use the 445 calendar for financial reporting and it is difficult when setting up reports for YTD, MTD, by quarter runs while only relying on a standard calendar. This module simplifies this by allowing you to set your own  start of the year date and weekending day.
